                        <p>At the age of 21 I first started to hitchhike from Tilburg, The Netherlands, to Ghent, Belgium with a friend who showed me how it is done.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after I hitched my way from Breda to Brussels in Belgium with another friend.</p>
                        <p>This was an eye opening experience for me. However I did not yet realize what kind of world was opening up to me.</p>

                        <p>In the spring I hitchhiked with another friend to Hamburg, making it the first time I hitched an entire day.</p>
                        <p>During the summer I hitchhiked all the way to Portugal, through France and Barcelona, making this the first solo and multiple day trip I had experienced up until that point in my life. This also included me free camping.</p>

                        <p>After having gathered enough savings, I made my way to Australia on a one year working holiday visa</p>
                        <p>During this year I made an entire loop hitchhiking around Australia, sleeping at the friendly people their homes I had met along the way or camping somewhere in the bushes, with the occassional hostel to experience the touristic sightseeing opportunities once I had arrived at my location.</p>
                        <p>I totalled 22,000km of hitchhiking in one year.</p>
                        <p>Because of the amount of savings I had and careful expenditure, I managed to almost go an entire year without having to work. Eventually at the end of 2015 I found a job in Perth, working 50 hour weeks in scorching heat of 40 degrees celsius, because it was summer in the southern hemisphere, as a mover.</p>

                    <div className='travel-story'>
                        <p>My one year in Australia came to an end and I took the opportunity and the extra savings from my summer job to travel around New Zealand. In a period of 6 weeks I hitchhiked a total of 5,000km criss cross throughout the south island.</p>
                        <p>I went back to Australia for one more month on a tourist visa to visit my newly made friends once more.</p>
                        <p>On the way home I made a stop in Singapore, to visit friends who I met by hitchhiking in Australia, and Bangkok to meet up with other friends. This was the first time I set foot in Asia as a backpacker.</p>
                        <p>In the northern hemisphere summer I hitchhiked around Europe after having worked my old bike messenger job for a few months. I started out this trip with my father, who was 61 at the time, we hitchhiked from Breda to Li√®ge in Belgium. I continued my way alone from there to visit friends and family in Lyon in France, Krakow in Poland and Berlin in Germany.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the year I decided to try to hitchhike my way all the way to Japan. For 7 weeks I hitched my way through Eastern Europe, seeing countries like Hungary, Croatia, Montenegro, Albania, Greece and Turkey. Due to poor preparations, like not having arranged any visa's or whatsoever, and it being the winter season, I decided to fly to Asia. With flights in The Netherlands being the cheapest and grabbing the opportunity to spend Christmas and New Years Eve with my friends and family, I turned around and went back home, visiting Bulgaria and Serbia along the way.</p>

                    <div className='travel-story'>
                        <p>A few days into the new year I flew out to Singapore, visiting my friends again there. I arranged a visa for Myanmar and hitchhiked my way there, through Malaysia and Thailand. This was the first time I hitchhiked in a totally different culture.</p>
                        <p>I spend 4 weeks in Myanmar, mainly hitchhiking the country, because that was the highlight of my trip there. Seeming as they do not have any rules regarding seatbelts and whatsoever, I hitched a lot of trucks, sitting on top of their load.</p>
                        <p>Eventually I made my way back to Thailand and hitched around there, made a stop in Bangkok for a few days and then made my way to Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>In Cambodia I also hitched around the entire country and gave a visit to a distant family relative who had been living there since 1991. I never met him before, but I took the opportunity to meet him.</p>
                        <p>After three weeks of experiencing the country I made my way back to Bangkok in Thailand and flew out to Japan.</p>
                        <p>For 5 weeks I traveled Japan. I started out on the island of Okinawa, where I hitched around for a week and then took a ferry to the mainland. I hitched my way up to the major cities. The first 3 weeks were hitchhiking and free camping. The last 2 weeks I stayed in Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo, residing at people I met through Couchsurfing or who I met on the streets. As of yet Japan still remains my absolute highlight of backpacking.</p>
                        <p>I made my way back home during the northern hemisphere summer, but not before I made another trip throughout Europe to visit my friends and family in Paris and Lyon.</p>

                    <div className='travel-story'>
                        <p>For the majority of this year I remained in Breda, working my old job as a bike messenger, saving up more money to sponsor my next travel and resting a bit from the constant change of lifestyle.</p>
                        <p>However I did go for a 7 week trip throughout Europe again. I hitchhiked my way to Marseille in France and continued my way from there to Italy.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately Italy forbids hitchhiking on their highways, so I did not want to risk getting in trouble with the police, so I decided to catch trains and busses from there, to experience cities like Genoa, Turin, Milan, Florence and Venice.</p>
                        <p>After I made my way through the north of Italy, I continued my way to Croatia. Hitchhiking the same roads I did back in 2016. I met up with my family in Split and Dubrovnik, who were their on a trip.</p>
                        <p>Eventually I made my way back to Montenegro and Serbia. From there I went onwards to Romania where I visited multiple cities.</p>
                        <p>I initially wanted to visit Ukraine after Romania, but I was tired of all the traveling and decided to go back home. A missed opportunity most people won't be experiencing any time soon unfortunately.</p>

                        <p>At the beginning of the year I flew out to Hong Kong. I arranged my China visa there and continued by train to China after having spend a week in the city.</p>
                        <p>I tried hitchhiking in China, but China was unlike any other country I had ever been. It was very difficult and most people did not seem to understand what I was doing when I approached them or when they drove past me. I decided to continue grabbing busses and trains from that point.</p>
                        <p>I had a 4 week visa, but after 3 weeks I decided to buy a last minute ticket to Bangkok, because I was not enjoying China as much as I hoped I would.</p>
                        <p>After enjoying Bangkok I hitched my way to Cambodia again to visit my family relative there.</p>
                        <p>I spend about 2 weeks in Cambodia and continued my way to Vietnam. I tried hitchihking there, but because I was traveling with someone else, and the majority of the country uses motorbikes, we could not easily hitch a ride. So we decided to takes busses and trains again.</p>
                        <p>Almost an entire month I spend in Vietnam and then I entered Laos from the north. There I could continue to hitchhike again. I explored the country from north to south, occassionally hiring a motorbike to drive around. Driving a motorbike in Asia is one my favourite activities ever.</p>
                        <p>When I left Laos I went to Bangkok again, and after a few days of re-energizing I hitched all the way to Singapore.</p>
                        <p>There again I met up with my friends.</p>
                        <p>I flew out to Australia on a tourist visa and stayed with a friend in Melbourne for 3 months. I could help him out at his job as a landscaper and they gave me cash in hand so I could support myself.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the year I flew out to New Zealand, with the intention to spend an entire year there on a working holiday visa, just like I did in Australia.</p>
                        <p>Just like in 2016 I hitched criss cross the country, but this time throughout the northern island.</p>
                        <p>In December of that year I found a job as a construction worker in Wellington.</p>

                        <p>At the beginning of the new year I went back to the south island to travel there and find a new job.</p>
                        <p>However as corona started happening and I was unsure of my plans, I made my way to Melbourne in Australia to stay with my friends and to figure out what my new course of action would be.</p>
                        <p>As the lockdowns started happening I was forced to take a flight back home to The Netherlands, unfortunately ending my travel instantly.</p>
                        <p>Upon my return back home I started working my old bike messenger job again.</p>

                        <p>In the autumn of 2021, when most lockdown restrictions were lifted, I decided to visit friends who I met throughout my travel or who moved away from Breda, throughout Europe. I hitchhiked my way to Hamburg in Germany, Innsbruck in Austria and to Italy. In Italy again I took busses and trains to get around.</p>
                        <p>I flew out to Vienna in Austria from Milan and continued my way by busses and trains to see Brno in Czech Republic, Bratislava in Slovakia and Budapest in Hungary.</p>
                        <p>Again I took a flight, this time from Budapest to Marseille in France. Straight upon arrival I hitched my from the airport to Montpellier and Toulouse.</p>
                        <p>I hitched my way from Toulouse back to Breda in 2 days. This was the first time I did not enjoy the hitchhiking itself anymore. Its magic does not affect me as much as it used to. I guess that is what you get after having hitchhiked approximately 80,000km in total.</p>

                        <p>I worked a job as a wheelchair mechanic for 8 months. With the money I saved from that job I decided to go for one more travel, before I would settle down for a while.</p>
                        <p>With friends I met in Australia, also through hitchhiking, I flew out to the United States of America, visiting cities like New York, New Orleans and Los Angeles for 2 weeks. Pure touristic travel though by planes and taxi's, no adventureous hitchhiking.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the trip I flew out with them to Australia. There I visited friends in Melbourne and in the Sunshine Coast. All by train, as I did not felt like going through the trouble of hitchhiking again.</p>

                        <p>A few days after New Years Eve I flew out to Perth, to attend a wedding of a couple I made friends with when I was hitchhiking around Australia in 2016.</p>
                        <p>From there I flew out to Bali in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Instead of traveling around, I felt the need to be alone for a while, so I could focus on my own projects. I tried video editing, read a lot of books and tried a programming course.</p>
                        <p>After having stayed put for 3 months, I decided that I would pursue a career in web development. With this decision I decided to sightsee Bali for the last 2 weeks and then fly out back to Europe.</p>
                        <p>I made a stop in Bangkok in Thailand for 2 weeks on the way home and then flew out to Frankfurt in Germany.</p>
                        <p>Because I knew this would be the last trip for many years to come, I wanted to visit my friends and family throughout Europe again. I went to Germany, Poland, Hungary and France.</p>
                        <p>I returned back home in the summer and have not ventured anywhere since.</p>
                        <p>Ever since I have been focusing on learning how to program from the 'full-stack engineer' course from Codecademy.</p>
