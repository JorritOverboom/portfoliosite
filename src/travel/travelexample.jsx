                        <p>At the age of 21, I embarked on my first hitchhiking journey from Tilburg, The Netherlands, to Ghent, Belgium, accompanied by a friend who showed me the ropes. This experience proved to be truly eye-opening, revealing to me a world of possibilities that I had yet to fully comprehend.</p>

                        <p>In the spring, I embarked on a hitchhiking adventure with another friend, journeying all the way to Hamburg. This marked the first time I spent an entire day hitchhiking, a memorable experience indeed.</p>
                        <p>During the summer months, I undertook a remarkable solo journey to Portugal, traversing through France and Barcelona along the way. This excursion was not only my first solo trip of multiple days but also introduced me to the world of free camping, enriching my travel experiences in ways I had never imagined.</p>

                        <p>After saving up enough funds, I embarked on a journey to Australia with a one-year working holiday visa in hand. Throughout the year, I embarked on an incredible adventure, hitchhiking around the entire country. Along the way, I found hospitality in the homes of friendly people I met and occasionally camped out under the stars or stayed in hostels to indulge in the local tourist attractions.</p>
                        <p>In total, I covered 22,000 kilometers through hitchhiking alone during that year. Thanks to careful budgeting and prudent spending, I managed to sustain myself for almost the entire year without needing to work. However, towards the end of 2015, I secured a job in Perth, where I worked grueling 50-hour weeks under the scorching heat of 40 degrees Celsius. Despite the challenging conditions, it was a rewarding experience as I embraced the summer season in the southern hemisphere, working as a mover.</p>

                    <div className='travel-story'>
                        <p>My year-long adventure in Australia eventually drew to a close, but I seized the opportunity and the extra savings I earned from my summer job to embark on further travels. I ventured to New Zealand, where over a span of six weeks, I hitchhiked an impressive 5,000 kilometers, crisscrossing throughout the picturesque landscapes of the South Island.</p>
                        <p>Upon returning to Australia for a brief period on a tourist visa, I eagerly reunited with the friends I had made during my time there. Before heading back home, I made memorable stops in Singapore to visit friends I had met through hitchhiking in Australia, and Bangkok to reconnect with other acquaintances. It marked my inaugural journey into Asia as a backpacker, opening up a whole new world of experiences.</p>
                        <p>During the following northern hemisphere summer, I embarked on a hitchhiking adventure across Europe after temporarily resuming my old job as a bike messenger for a few months. The journey commenced with my father, who joined me at the age of 61, as we hitchhiked from Breda to Li√®ge in Belgium. Continuing solo thereafter, I visited friends and family in Lyon, France, Krakow, Poland, and Berlin, Germany.</p>
                        <p>As the year drew to a close, I embarked on an ambitious quest to hitchhike all the way to Japan. Over seven weeks, I hitchhiked through Eastern Europe, traversing countries such as Hungary, Croatia, Montenegro, Albania, Greece, and Turkey. However, unforeseen challenges, such as inadequate visa arrangements and harsh winter conditions, prompted me to alter my plans. Opting for a flight from The Netherlands, I returned home, making memorable stops in Bulgaria and Serbia along the way, and eventually reuniting with my friends and family for Christmas and New Year's Eve."</p>

                    <div className='travel-story'>
                        <p>In the early days of the new year, I embarked on another journey, flying to Singapore to reunite with my friends. From there, I obtained a visa for Myanmar and began hitchhiking my way through Malaysia and Thailand en route to my destination. It marked my first experience hitchhiking in a vastly different cultural setting.</p>
                        <p>Myanmar captivated me for four weeks as I traversed the country primarily by hitchhiking, a highlight of my time there. With minimal regulations on seatbelts and safety measures, I often found myself atop trucks, embracing the unique adventure.</p>
                        <p>Returning to Thailand, I continued hitchhiking and explored Bangkok briefly before journeying onward to Cambodia. Hitchhiking across Cambodia allowed me to immerse myself fully in the country's charm, culminating in a visit to a distant family relative residing there since 1991, whom I had never met before.</p>
                        <p>After three enriching weeks in Cambodia, I returned to Bangkok and boarded a flight to Japan. Over the course of five weeks, I traversed the Land of the Rising Sun, beginning on the island of Okinawa before ferrying to the mainland. Hitchhiking through major cities and indulging in free camping for the initial three weeks, I later savored the hospitality of locals in Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo, facilitated through Couchsurfing and chance encounters. Japan undoubtedly remains the pinnacle of my backpacking adventures thus far.</p>
                        <p>As the northern hemisphere summer approached, I embarked on my journey homeward, punctuated by a delightful detour through Europe to reconnect with loved ones in Paris and Lyon.</p>

                    <div className='travel-story'>
                        <p>For the better part of the year, I settled in Breda, returning to my former job as a bike messenger. This period allowed me to replenish my savings for future travels and embrace the stability after the constant flux of life on the road.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the wanderlust still beckoned, prompting a seven-week European adventure. Hitchhiking took me to Marseille, France, where I embarked on a journey through Italy. However, Italy's strict regulations on hitchhiking along highways led me to opt for trains and buses, enabling me to explore vibrant cities like Genoa, Turin, Milan, Florence, and Venice.</p>
                        <p>After traversing northern Italy, I continued my journey to Croatia, retracing familiar roads from my previous travels. I rendezvoused with my family in Split and Dubrovnik, joining them on their vacation. Subsequently, I ventured back to Montenegro and Serbia before venturing forth to Romania, where I delved into the charms of multiple cities.</p>
                        <p>While initially considering a visit to Ukraine following my time in Romania, fatigue from constant travel set in, prompting me to make the decision to return home. It was a missed opportunity, one that many may not have the chance to experience anytime soon.</p>

                        <p>At the onset of the year, I embarked on a journey to Hong Kong, where I organized my China visa before boarding a train bound for China after a week in the city. Attempting hitchhiking in China proved to be a unique challenge unlike any other country I had visited. With most locals unfamiliar with the concept, I soon switched to buses and trains for transportation.</p>
                        <p>Despite having a four-week visa, my discontent with China led me to purchase a spontaneous ticket to Bangkok after just three weeks. After relishing the vibrant atmosphere of Bangkok, I hitched my way back to Cambodia to visit my family relative, spending approximately two weeks there before continuing my journey to Vietnam. Hitchhiking proved difficult in Vietnam due to traveling with a companion and the prevalence of motorbikes, prompting us to resort to buses and trains.</p>
                        <p>Nearly a month was spent exploring Vietnam before venturing into Laos from the north, where hitchhiking became viable once more. Traversing the country from north to south, I occasionally rented a motorbike to navigate the scenic landscapes, a cherished activity in Asian travel.</p>
                        <p>Departing Laos, I returned to Bangkok for a brief respite before hitching my way to Singapore, where I reunited with friends once again. Subsequently, I flew to Australia on a tourist visa, residing with a friend in Melbourne for three months. There, I contributed to his landscaping job and received cash in hand to sustain myself.</p>
                        <p>As the year drew to a close, I embarked on a journey to New Zealand with plans for a year-long working holiday visa, mirroring my experience in Australia. Similar to 2016, I hitchhiked across the country, this time exploring the wonders of the North Island. In December, I secured a job as a construction worker in Wellington, marking the culmination of a transformative year of travel and new experiences.</p>

                        <p>At the onset of the new year, I returned to the South Island of New Zealand to explore its breathtaking landscapes and seek out new job opportunities. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic began to unfold, casting uncertainty over my plans, I decided to seek refuge with friends in Melbourne, Australia, to assess my options.</p>
                        <p>As lockdowns became imminent, I found myself compelled to hastily book a flight back to The Netherlands, abruptly halting my travels. Upon my return home, I resumed my former role as a bike messenger, adapting to the familiar rhythm of life while reminiscing about the adventures that had come to an unexpected pause.</p>

                        <p>In the autumn of 2021, with the easing of lockdown restrictions, I embarked on a journey to reconnect with friends scattered across Europe, whom I had met during my travels or who had relocated from Breda. Hitchhiking became my mode of transport once more as I made my way to Hamburg in Germany, Innsbruck in Austria, and various destinations in Italy, relying on buses and trains within the country.</p>
                        <p>From Milan, I caught a flight to Vienna, Austria, and continued my expedition via buses and trains to explore Brno in the Czech Republic, Bratislava in Slovakia, and Budapest in Hungary.</p>
                        <p>Another flight took me from Budapest to Marseille in France. Upon arrival, I promptly hitchhiked from the airport to Montpellier and Toulouse, tracing my way back to Breda over two days. It was during this journey that I realized a shift within myself ‚Äî the enchantment of hitchhiking, once so profound, now waned. Perhaps after covering approximately 80,000 kilometers on the road, its allure had dimmed.</p>

                        <p>I spent 8 months working as a wheelchair mechanic, diligently saving every penny for one final adventure before settling down. Joined by friends I had met during my travels in Australia, many of whom were also hitchhiking enthusiasts, we embarked on a two-week tour of the United States of America. Our journey took us through iconic cities like New York, New Orleans, and Los Angeles, although this time, we opted for conventional tourist travel methods such as planes and taxis, foregoing the adventurous spirit of hitchhiking.</p>
                        <p>As our American excursion came to a close, I accompanied my friends back to Australia, where we visited Melbourne and the Sunshine Coast. This time, however, I chose the convenience of trains over the unpredictability of hitchhiking, allowing myself to savor the company of friends without the added challenge of thumbing rides from strangers.</p>

                        <p>After celebrating New Year's Eve, I jetted off to Perth to attend the wedding of a couple I befriended during my hitchhiking adventures around Australia in 2016. Following the festivities, I traveled to Bali, Indonesia, seeking solitude to delve into personal projects. Immersed in video editing, devouring books, and experimenting with a programming course, I relished the opportunity for self-reflection and growth.</p>
                        <p>After three months of introspection, I resolved to pursue a career in web development. Before returning to Europe, I took two weeks to explore Bali's scenic wonders. En route home, I made a brief stop in Bangkok, Thailand, for two weeks before landing in Frankfurt, Germany.</p>
                        <p>Aware that this journey marked the end of my nomadic lifestyle for the foreseeable future, I embarked on a heartfelt tour across Europe, reconnecting with friends and family. From vibrant cities like Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin, and Munich in Germany, to cultural gems like Krakow in Poland, Budapest in Hungary, and Toulouse, Montauban, and the Ard√®che in France, I treasured each reunion.</p>
                        <p>Upon returning home in the summer, I dedicated myself to mastering programming through the 'full-stack engineer' course on Codecademy, embracing the next chapter of my journey with enthusiasm and determination.</p>
