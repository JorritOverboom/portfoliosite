Along the way, I found hospitality in the homes of friendly people I met and occasionally camped out under the stars or stayed in hostels to have some rest from the road.",

Due to the fact that I was hardly ever going to restaurants and was staying at the homes of the people I met along the way or in the homes of the friends I made along the way, I managed to sustain myself for almost the entire year without needing to work. However, towards the end of 2015, I secured a job in Perth, where I worked grueling 50-hour weeks under the scorching heat of 40 degrees Celsius. Despite the challenging conditions, it was a rewarding experience as I embraced the summer season in the southern hemisphere, working as a mover.",

            "After the change of the new year, I jetted off to Perth to attend the wedding of a couple I met through a hitchhike back in 2016, shortly after my summer job there. Following the festivities, I traveled to Bali, Indonesia, seeking solitude due to a strong urge of being alone for a while so I could delve into personal projects. Immersed in video editing, devouring books, and experimenting with the programming course, which I eventually decided to focus on upon my return back home, I relished the opportunity for self-reflection and rest of my lifestyle.",
            "After three months of introspection, I resolved to pursue a career in web development. Before returning to Europe, I took two weeks to explore Bali's scenic wonders, visiting the islands around Bali such as Gili Air, Nusa Penida and others. En route home, I made a stop in my beloved city of Bangkok for two weeks before landing in Frankfurt.",
            "Aware that this journey marked the end of my nomadic lifestyle for the foreseeable future, I embarked on a heartfelt tour across Europe, reconnecting with friends and family. From vibrant cities like Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin, and Munich in Germany, to cultural gems like Krakow, Budapest, Toulouse, Montauban, and the Ard√®che in France.",
            "Upon returning home in the summer, I dedicated myself to mastering programming through the 'full-stack engineer' course on Codecademy, embracing the next chapter of my journey with enthusiasm and determination.",
