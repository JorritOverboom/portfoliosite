                        <h4>Wheelchair mechanic</h4>
                        <p>Raamsdonkveer, The Netherlands</p>
                    </div>
                    <div className='working-description'>
                        <p>Initially I was asked to deliver and pick up wheelchairs at locations around the country, however the job instantly turned out to be me becoming a wheelchair mechanic. I worked in a workshop in Raamsdonkveer for the majority of 2022. I was responsible for resizing existing wheelchairs to fit the size of the client which it was requested for. This involved me knowing a variaty of wheelchairs and their associated parts. Knowing which tools to use and how. Seeming as I was the main mechanic, I had to monitor other freelance mechanics (we were understaffed), do the administration, communicate with the office for missing parts or corrections on the workingform and teach other colleagues parts of my job in case I would get sick.</p>

                    <div className='working-description'>
                        <p>For a few months I worked for Lightyear in Helmond in 2021. An ambitious company designing and producing solar panel powered cars. I was asked to assist the solar team to produce a variaty of solar panels for the car for a testing phase. This involved me having to carefully align all the existing parts of a solar panel and prepare them for being heated in a large oven.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div className='working-description'>
                        <p>This was my main job for years, working to save up money, go traveling and coming back to it once my funds were depleted. At average I made 60km a day, cycling all around Breda to deliver packages to clients. This could be anything for anyone including law firms, dentists, city councils, pharmacies and people who have ordered products online. The packages would be documents, dental stuff, medicine, clothes, electronics, bike parts, anything small enough to fit the bags or bikes. Initially I did everyone on my own city bike, but eventually the company got electronic cargo bikes, allowing us to be able to carry more than we ever did before.</p>

                        <p>At the end of 2019 I resided in Wellington for a while working as a construction worker. Right in the middle of the city a new building was built. I had to carry around a lot of steel, push wheelbarrows full of concrete around the site and use a variaty of tools to do whatever choirs they made me do.</p>

                        <p>In 2019 and 2020, before and after I went to New Zealand, and before the pandemic happened, I worked as a landscaper in Melbourne. This involved me making a lot of cement mixes, grinding stones for pathways, pushing around wheelbarrows full of cement or sand, a lot of digging with shoveles and planting trees.</p>
